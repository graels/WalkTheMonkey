Problem:

There is a monkey which can walk around on a planar grid. The monkey can move one space
at a time left, right, up or down. That is, from (x, y) the monkey can go to (x+1, y),
(x-1, y), (x, y+1), and (x, y-1). Points where the sum of the digits of the absolute
value of the x coordinate plus the sum of the digits of the absolute value of the y
coordinate are lesser than or equal to 25 are accessible to the monkey. For example,
the point (59, 79) is inaccessible because 5 + 9 + 7 + 9 = 30, which is greater
than 25.  Another example: the point (-5, -7) is accessible because
abs(-5) + abs(-7) = 5 + 7 = 12, which is less than 25.  How many points can the monkey
access if it starts at (0, 0), including (0, 0) itself?
