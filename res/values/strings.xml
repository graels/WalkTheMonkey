    <string name="problem_statement">
        There is a monkey which can walk around on a planar grid. The monkey can move one space at a time left, right, up
        or down. That is, from (x, y) the monkey can go to (x+1, y), (x-1, y), (x, y+1), and (x, y-1). Points where the
        sum of the digits of the absolute value of the x coordinate plus the sum of the digits of the absolute value of
        the y coordinate are lesser than or equal to 25 are accessible to the monkey. For example, the point (59, 79) is
        inaccessible because 5 + 9 + 7 + 9 = 30, which is greater than 25. Another example: the point (-5, -7) is
        accessible because abs(-5) + abs(-7) = 5 + 7 = 12, which is less than 25.  How many points can the monkey
        access if it starts at (0, 0), including (0, 0) itself?
